The ominous, ethereal darkness coverring the forsest floor undulates and twists for a fleeting moment, only to splinter into five distinct entities. From this fractured darkness emerges a quintet of menacing silhouettes, each transforming into a spectral embodiment. In this macabre display, the once-unified shadow now manifests as five formidable shadowy creatures [[Nexus Shade]].

Upon vanquishing a Shade, the ethereal shadow retraces its spectral tendrils back to the nexus, where ominous red cracks ominously begin to fracture its dark facade. With each defeated Shade, the rifts deepen, the nexus succumbing to the relentless assault. As the last Shade falls, the once-imposing nexus crumbles to the forest floor. Yet, from the remnants, the shadows coalesce, intertwining to forge a singular, imposing humanoid figureâ€”the emergence of [[Malistra (Mini Boss)]], her formidable presence unveiled in the aftermath of the nexus's demise.
