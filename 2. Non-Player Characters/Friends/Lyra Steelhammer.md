## Description

Lyra Steelhammer, the blacksmith of Greenest, is a robust and weathered woman in her early forties. Standing at an average height, she possesses a sturdy build that reflects years of hard work at the forge. Her skin, tanned from exposure to the heat of the forge, bears the marks of countless tiny burns and scars, attesting to the dedication she has put into her craft.

Lyra's piercing blue eyes are framed by crow's feet, evidence of both the passing of time and the many hours she has spent squinting in the bright glow of molten metal. Her raven-black hair is often pulled back into a practical bun, keeping it out of her face during the intense labor of blacksmithing. She typically adorns herself in a simple leather apron, stained with the soot and sweat of her work, and her hands are calloused from years of wielding hammers and tongs.
