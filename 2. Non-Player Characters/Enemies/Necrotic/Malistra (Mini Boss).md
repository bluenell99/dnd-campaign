## Description

Dark Enchanter Malistra stands tall, his raven-black robes billowing as if infused with shadow itself. Piercing violet eyes gleam with malevolence beneath a hooded cowl, revealing an arcane prowess. His slender fingers trace the air, conjuring corrupted energy that dances ominously around him. Commanding the malevolent force within the corrupted nexus, Malistra embodies the intersection of dark magic and a thirst for power, posing a formidable challenge for any who dare to confront her in the tainted forest.

### Actions

**Multi-attack** - Malistra can take two actions on it's turn. 

### Spellcasting

Spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following spells prepared:

#### Cantrips

**Chill Touch** : - You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn. This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

**Mage Hand** - A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.  You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.   The hand can’t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

**Necrotic Blast**: A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 necrotic damage.

#### 1st Level

**Mage Armor** - You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target’s base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.

**Ray of Sickness** A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn.

#### 2nd Level 

**Blindness/Deafness** - You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) or [deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Deafened) (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

**Hold Person** - Choose a humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

#### 3rd Level

**Counterspell** - - You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.  **At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.
