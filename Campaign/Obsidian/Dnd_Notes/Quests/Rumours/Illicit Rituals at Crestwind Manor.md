If the players decide to ask for rumors within Holstead, they might get told about this rumour.

> "Ye be new in Holstead, aye? Then perhaps ye've not heard the tales of Crestwind Manor and the enigma that is Lord Thorne."
> 
>Folks here speak of forbidden magics, they do. Say Lord Thorne, he ain't just a nobleman—he's a wielder of arcane powers, practicin' rituals not meant for the mortal coil. Some believe it's tied to an ancient pact struck by his kin, a deal made with the unknown in exchange for power and prosperity."
>
>"And the rituals, oh, they're held in the dead of night. Whispered incantations that send shivers down the spine, and lights flickerin' like the spirits themselves are watchin'. But I ain't gonna say no more. I ain't gettin' dragged any more into it"


The players can investigate Crestwind Manor and talk with Lord Thorne. They can try and sneak into the building and find the [[Summoning chamber]] below. 

He will initially deny the accusations, attempting to maintain the façade of a nobleman wrongfully accused. He will claim that the rumors are baseless and fueled by jealousy or misunderstanding. He will try and divert the conversation by talking about the town, offering them free board at the Tavern if they stop going on about it. 

If the players keep prying, he will grow increasingly agitated, saying that he doesn't want to talk about stories and rumours anymore and demands they leave.

If the players have investigated the Summoning chamber, they can confront Lord Thorne about it. If the players can intimidate, bribe, or persuade thorne.
