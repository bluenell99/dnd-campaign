As characters approach Greenest, they see that a blue dragon and its [[Cult of the Dragon]] allies are attacking the town. The cultists seek to collect treasure that they
hope to present to Tiamat upon her arrival in the world. The cult has assembled a powerful force for this raid by gathering bandits, kobolds, sellswords, and other mer
cenary types into a small army. A monk named Leosin Erlanthar was also in town. Through diligent research and interviews conducted during his travels between
Berdusk and Candlekeep, Leosin became convinced that the cult is engaged in a big operation, but he doesn’t yet know what it is. Leosin uses the raid as an opportu
nity to infiltrate the cult so that he can learn more about the cult’s plans. He is discovered and captured, however, and needs the characters’ help to escape from captivity. 

Characters can engage in several encounters while [[Cultist]] and [[Kobold]] rampage through Greenest. 

## Seek the keep

Characters have random encounters with raiders when they enter Greenest, but this one should be their first mission of the episode. It begins when a terrified human
family (father, mother, and three young children) dash across their path, hounded by eight kobolds. 

> "Without warning, five humans dash out from between two buildings on your left. A limping man and three young children race across the street into more shadows, and a woman carrying a round shield and a broken spear turns and faces back in the direction from which they came. Eight kobolds stream out of the alley on the family’s heels and fan out around the woman, who looks determined to delay the creatures for as long as possible."

Unless characters interfere, the kobolds assume the characters are cultists and ignore them to concentrate on killing the woman first, her family second. Assuming
characters intervene and save the family, Linan explains that they must make their way to the keep it’sthe only safe place in Greenest. 

To reach the keep, the characters must make it past three groups of raiders. A group consists of 1d6 [[Kobold]] and 1d4 [[[Cultist]]]]. If the group contains six kobolds, one
is a [[Winged Kobold]]


## Save the Mill

> “The guards have spotted a new threat. Raiders are trying to set fire to the town’s mill. If it burns, we’ll lose our stockpile of flour and we won’t be able to grind more for months. I’m trying to assemble enough defenders from here in the keep to defend it through the rest of the night, but that will take time. You’d do us a great service if you could get to the mill quickly and drive away the raiders before they can set it aflame. You’ll need to defend it until our force arrives to take over, but it shouldn’t be more than fifteen minutes behind you.”
