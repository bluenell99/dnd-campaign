In the aftermath of the devastating dragon attack and the raid by cultists and kobolds, Greenest bears the scars of recent turmoil. The once-tranquil streets are now marred by the remnants of chaos. Many buildings, once proud symbols of the town's resilience, now stand damaged and blackened by the dragon's fiery breath.

The central square, once a lively gathering place, is now a somber scene. The fountain, a symbol of unity, stands cracked and dry. Tattered banners flap eerily in the wind, hinting at the recent violence that unfolded. Debris litters the cobblestone streets, and the air is thick with an unsettling tension.

The wooden palisade, though it held against the initial onslaught, bears visible signs of the struggle. Gaps in the defenses reveal the vulnerability the town faced, and makeshift repairs are evident as the townspeople work tirelessly to mend what was broken. Guard towers, once vigilant, now stand as silent witnesses to the recent mayhem.

The market square, once alive with the vibrancy of trade, now hosts makeshift tents and aid stations. Townsfolk, with wearied expressions, tend to the wounded and console those who lost their homes. The market stalls, many reduced to charred remnants, serve as a stark reminder of the destructive power that descended upon Greenest.

The atmosphere in Greenest is one of resilience mixed with palpable fear. The townspeople, though shaken, are determined to rebuild. Some huddle in groups, discussing plans for reconstruction, while others solemnly search through the wreckage for remnants of their former lives.

As the sun sets over the scarred landscape, the people of Greenest begin to light lanterns and torches, casting long shadows on the damaged buildings. The town, once a beacon of peace, now stands as a symbol of both the fragility of life and the strength of a community united in the face of adversity.
