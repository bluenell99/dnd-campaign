### Wild Rage Surge

On entering **rage** the player must roll a `d20`. A critical hit returns a failure and the DM must roll a `d100` from the wild magic table in the PHB. For each success the failure rating reduces by 1 each time. For example, if the player doesn't roll a 1, the failure rating becomes either a 1 or 2. If they don't fail again, it becomes a 1, 2 or 3 and so on. 

### Potions as a bonus action.

The party are allowed to use potions as a bonus action

### DM dice for hit dice level up

Both PC and DM will roll hit dice when levelling up and PC can take the higher result


### Crit Double Damage

On a critical hit, instead of rolling damage twice, the PC can roll once, add the modifiers, and double it. Works for enemies too.
