### Wild Rage Surge

On entering **rage** the player must roll a `d20`. A critical hit returns a failure and the DM must roll a `d100` from the wild magic table in the PHB. For each success the failure rating reduces by 1 each time. For example, if the player doesn't roll a 1, the failure rating becomes either a 1 or 2. If they don't fail again, it becomes a 1, 2 or 3 and so on.
