Helga and Oslwald buy a bedroll from the general goods store in holstead

They embark on the journey to Greenest, around a week's worth of travel

On the first day they encounter the [[Local Nitty]] where Oswald used Cure Wounds to break the NPCs drunken state. The NPC left the keg of ale for the party as a thank you but they just had a drink each and left it.

They camp and decide to forage, hunt, and start a fire. Daisy is able to find lots of Thyme and a small amount of firewood. Pete and Helga team up to hunt for deer. Helga lands a hit with the javelin and kills a deer. Helga convinced daisy that the deer was found hurt and they had to "put it out of it's misery". 

Helga butchered the deer and was only able to collect enough deer for the party for one night.

Only a small amount of firewood was found and only lasted one night. 

They also encountered the [[Lost Familar]]. Pete used his "Speaking with animals" ability and was able to acertain that the cat is a familiar of a wizard and the party escorted the cat, Benjamin, back to the wizards tower. 

Helga and Daisy were skeptical of the wizard and the cat but went along with the party. 

The wizard, [[Uldren Thrice Winter]] was very happy to see the return of the cat and rewarded the players with some food and a potion of healing each. 

The players pushed on their journey, through the night on one occasion.

When they were about a day away from [[Greenest]], the noticed the dragon flying above. They made their final push to the city and arrived in the early hours of the morning. 

They came across a group of [[Kobold]] attacking a small group of townspeople. They were able to save them where they were led to the sewer entrance. They climbed through and were greeted by [[Governor Nighthill]] and quested with rescuing townspeople from the Chapel and the Mill. 

The party head to the chapel, but are first interrupted by a group of 5 kobolds. They were able to beat the kobolds and headed to the chapel.

They chose to try and gain access to the chapel through the back and were met by three kobolds and 2 [[Cultist]]. They killed the raiding party where Daisy got the most kills. Daisy and Pete both looted the cultists and found an emblem token containing the [[Cult of the Dragon]] symbol.
