## Recap and Inspiration Questions

After concluding their raid on Greenest, the party embarked on a shopping spree, with Tiny Pete and Daisy visiting Arianna's Artisanal Bakes for meager food supplies, while Helga and Oswald claimed rewards from Steelhammer Forge. The damaged Eldrin's Apothecary & Cauldron yielded a health potion deal after they found the owner hiding. Their journey south took a tragic turn as they failed an ambush, resulting in Tiny Pete's death. Mourning and planning at The Grassland Tavern ensued. Returning with vengeance, they discovered a massive cultist camp, devised a distraction, and rescued prisoners Leosin and Thorn. Leosin unveiled the Cult of the Dragon's plot involving dragon hatcheries and the resurrection of Tiamat. The group, armed with this information, prepared for the impending challenge ahead.
