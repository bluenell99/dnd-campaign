## Recap & Inspiration Questions

**Recap**

Helga and Oswald, on their journey to Greenest, encountered the Local Nitty on the first day. Oswald used his healing powers to sober up the drunken NPC, who then left a keg of ale as thanks. The party only had a drink each and moved on. While camping, they foraged and hunted, with Helga successfully landing a hit to kill a deer. Helga convinced Daisy to believe it was wounded, justifying the kill. However, the party only collected enough deer for one night, and the firewood was scarce, lasting only that night.

On their way, they encountered a Lost Familiar, a cat named Benjamin, who they escorted back to the wizard Uldren Thrice Winter. Despite the skepticism, Uldren was grateful and rewarded them with food and healing potions. Continuing their journey through the night, they arrived in Greenest, witnessing a dragon flying overhead. They saved townspeople from Kobold attacks and were tasked by Governor Nighthill to rescue more from the Chapel and the Mill.

After defeating a group of Kobolds, the party tried to enter the chapel from the back, encountering more Kobolds and Cultists. Daisy excelled in combat, and looting the Cultists revealed an emblem token of the Cult of the Dragon. Successfully rescuing townspeople, they are now heading back to the keep for safety.

## Save the mill

"You've brought a glimmer of hope to Greenest, and for that, I thank you. However, the shadows of danger still loom. The mill is yet to be secured, and its fate hangs in the balance. I implore you to press on; the threat persists, and our town's survival depends on your continued valor"

## Notes

After successfully returning a group of townsfolk to the keep for safety, the party was tasked by [[Governor Nighthill]] to rescue some more townsfolk from the mill. 

The group asked Nighthill if there are any barrels laying around in the pantry that they could use as a way to sneak around the raiding groups. Nighthill was able to help, and provided the group with 4 barrels.

They approached the main door of the castle, where they decided that all but Oswald would use the barrels as a way to knock over any potential enemies at the base of the keep drawbridge. Oswald would open the door at just before to ensure a surprise attack.  Only Helga was successful in knocking down enemies, as the other barrels didn't really move. 

During the battle, Pete was knocked unconscious by a kobold sling, but was revived by Daisy using her health potion. Before Pete was stabilised, she tried to steal Pete's potion, to which Oswald saw but decided to not say anything. 

After defeating the drawbridge enemies, the party decided to split up on their way to the mill. Daisy and Pete decided to use a barrel to hide. They rolled it down the hill the keep sits on towards the river. They were able to get inside the barrel in the river and proceeded to float downstream towards the mill. 

Helga and Oswald continued along the roads, ensuring there would be a safe passage back for the resuced townsfolk. They encountered a large raiding group guarding the entrance bridge to greenest. The raiders didn't spot the party, but Helga decided to use her rage and went in for the attack. It was a tough fight, but sucessful thanks to help from Daisy and Pete in their barrel. Pete threw a bag of 1000 ball bearings onto the bridge in an attempt to knock over the kobolds and cultists. Daisy also popped her head outside of the barrel and was able to snipe an enemy down with her longbow. This caught the attention of one of the kobolds who retaliated by throwing a sling at the barrel, causing it to break.

Daisy and Pete came onto the shore of the river and sneak attacked a cultist and kobold trying to enter the mill. This alerted the other kobold but at the same time Helga and Oslwad approached where Helga went in with her axe to finish him off. 

They saved the remaining townsfolk from the mill and started their journey back to the keep. One of the townsfolk was a blacksmith lady called [[Lyra Steelhammer]] who offered a reward for her safe return. 

As the party approached the keep, they were intercepted by a large wall of Kobolds and cultists as the base of the drawbridge, with a number of townsfolk held hostage. This final raiding party was lead by [[Langdedrosa Cyanwrath (Mini Boss)]] who challenges the party to 1v1 dual for honour's sake. Helga accepted the challange, to which she nearly defeated Langdredosa. Unfortunatley, Helga was knocked unconcious and the raiding party left greenest. 

Nighthill thanked and congratulated the party and offered Greenest as a safe place for the party to return to in the future, as well as offered any services to the player as a sign of gratitude. He also offers the party 250 gold each for finding intel about the raiding party, as well as returning any stolen goods from greenest. During this conversation. the party was also approached by a limping monk named [[Nesim Waladra]] who mentioned his master [[Leosin Erlanthar]] was likely captured by the raiders and asked if they could search for him at the raiders camp to the south.
