## Recap & Inspiration Questions

**Recap**

Helga and Oswald, on their journey to Greenest, encountered the Local Nitty on the first day. Oswald used his healing powers to sober up the drunken NPC, who then left a keg of ale as thanks. The party only had a drink each and moved on. While camping, they foraged and hunted, with Helga successfully landing a hit to kill a deer. Helga convinced Daisy to believe it was wounded, justifying the kill. However, the party only collected enough deer for one night, and the firewood was scarce, lasting only that night.

On their way, they encountered a Lost Familiar, a cat named Benjamin, who they escorted back to the wizard Uldren Thrice Winter. Despite skepticism, Uldren was grateful and rewarded them with food and healing potions. Continuing their journey through the night, they arrived in Greenest, witnessing a dragon flying overhead. They saved townspeople from Kobold attacks and were tasked by Governor Nighthill to rescue more from the Chapel and the Mill.

After defeating a group of Kobolds, the party tried to enter the chapel from the back, encountering more Kobolds and Cultists. Daisy excelled in combat, and looting the Cultists revealed an emblem token of the Cult of the Dragon. Successfully rescuing townspeople, they are now heading back to the keep for safety.

**Questions**
