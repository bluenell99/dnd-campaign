## Recap and Inspiration Questions
  
Having successfully safeguarded a group of townsfolk within the keep, Governor Nighthill entrusted the party with the crucial mission of rescuing additional citizens held captive at the mill. Seeking an advantage, the group approached Nighthill with a strategic plan, inquiring about barrels in the pantry. Nighthill proved helpful, providing them with four barrels. Positioned at the main drawbridge, the party decided on a diversionary tactic. All but Oswald utilized the barrels to topple potential enemies at the bridge's base, while Oswald, moments before the attack, opened the drawbridge for a surprise assault. Although only Helga succeeded in knocking down foes, the party emerged victorious after a challenging encounter.

During the skirmish, Pete suffered a setback, being knocked unconscious by a kobold sling. Daisy, however, swiftly intervened, using her health potion to revive Pete. Before stabilizing, Pete's attempt to pilfer the potion went unnoticed by Oswald, who chose to keep quiet about the incident. With the drawbridge cleared, the party divided their forces. Daisy and Pete opted for a river route, utilizing a barrel to float downstream toward the mill, while Helga and Oswald ensured a safe path for the rescued townsfolk along the roads.

Their journey continued with an unexpected encounter, as Helga's audacious attack initiated a formidable battle against a large raiding group guarding the entrance bridge to Greenest. Employing inventive tactics involving ball bearings and precision shots from the barrel, the party overcame the opposition. However, Daisy and Pete's barrel was damaged in the process. Joining forces with Helga and Oswald, they successfully rescued townsfolk from the mill, including Lyra Steelhammer, the grateful blacksmith who pledged a reward for her safe return.

As the party returned to the keep, a final, formidable challenge awaited them. A significant force of Kobolds and cultists, led by Langdedrosa Cyanwrath, blocked their path. Helga accepted a 1v1 challenge, nearly prevailing against Langdedrosa before succumbing to unconsciousness. The raiding party, satisfied with their display of strength, departed Greenest. Governor Nighthill expressed gratitude, offering thanks and rewards. In the midst of their conversation, the party was approached by Nesim Waladra, a limping monk seeking assistance in locating his captured master, Leosin Erlanthar, at the raiders' camp to the south.
