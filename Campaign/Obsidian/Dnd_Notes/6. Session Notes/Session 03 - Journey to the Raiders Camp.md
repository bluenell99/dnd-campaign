## Recap and Inspiration Questions
  
Having successfully safeguarded a group of townsfolk within the keep, Governor Nighthill entrusted the party with the crucial mission of rescuing additional citizens held captive at the mill. Seeking an advantage, the group approached Nighthill with a strategic plan, inquiring about barrels in the pantry. Nighthill proved helpful, providing them with four barrels. Positioned at the main drawbridge, the party decided on a diversionary tactic. All but Oswald utilized the barrels to topple potential enemies at the bridge's base, while Oswald, moments before the attack, opened the drawbridge for a surprise assault. Although only Helga succeeded in knocking down foes, the party emerged victorious after a challenging encounter.

During the skirmish, Pete suffered a setback, being knocked unconscious by a kobold sling. Daisy, however, swiftly intervened, using her health potion to revive Pete. Before stabilizing, Pete's attempt to pilfer the potion went unnoticed by Oswald, who chose to keep quiet about the incident. With the drawbridge cleared, the party divided their forces. Daisy and Pete opted for a river route, utilizing a barrel to float downstream toward the mill, while Helga and Oswald ensured a safe path for the rescued townsfolk along the roads.

Their journey continued with an unexpected encounter, as Helga's audacious attack initiated a formidable battle against a large raiding group guarding the entrance bridge to Greenest. Employing inventive tactics involving ball bearings and precision shots from the barrel, the party overcame the opposition. However, Daisy and Pete's barrel was damaged in the process. Joining forces with Helga and Oswald, they successfully rescued townsfolk from the mill, including Lyra Steelhammer, the grateful blacksmith who pledged a reward for her safe return.

As the party returned to the keep, a final, formidable challenge awaited them. A significant force of Kobolds and cultists, led by Langdedrosa Cyanwrath, blocked their path. Helga accepted a 1v1 challenge, nearly prevailing against Langdedrosa before succumbing to unconsciousness. The raiding party, satisfied with their display of strength, departed Greenest. Governor Nighthill expressed gratitude, offering thanks and rewards. In the midst of their conversation, the party was approached by Nesim Waladra, a limping monk seeking assistance in locating his captured master, Leosin Erlanthar, at the raiders' camp to the south.

## Events

### Shopping

- Now that the raid has ended, the party decided to wander around Greenest to establish what shops were still open. Tiny Pete and Daisy went to [[Arianna's Artisanal Bakes]]] to stock up on some food. All the sweet food was gone, leaving only a couple of butter croissants and some day old bread. Arianna asked the two if they could return/find any berries in their travels.
- Helga and Oswald went to [[Steelhammer Forge]] where they spoke to a startled [[Lyra Steelhammer]]. She previously told the party that she'd reward them for rescuing her from the mill. She rewarded Helga with a +1 damage modifier to her hand-axes.
- They all went to [[Eldrin's Apothecary & Cauldron]] which was significantly damaged and looted from the raid. They found Eldrin hiding in the room behind the counter and convinced him to give them a health potion each in return for them bringing any stolen potions and ingredients that they could find
### Journey

- The party headed south, tracking some footprints and a parting in the grasslands. 
- They approached what looked like a clearing with light smoke raising above.
- A sneak attack was planned where they would attack at the same time and ambush a stragglers group of 4 kobolds and 4 cultists. They failed...
- The battle took a turn for the worse as Tiny Pete was knocked unconscious. After being stabilised by Oswald, a kobold took an opportunity to attack Pete whilst he was down, landing a critical hit. Pete was unable to stabilise, and was killed.
- It was a sombre moment, and a frenzy of rage came out of each of the characters as they made their final attacks to wipe out the group. The mission was paused as they closed Pete's eyes, and carried him back to Greenest. They burried him, with a croissant in his arms, by the bakery. Oswald took a piece of fallen wood and snapped it to make a cross. He said a prayer and they went to [[The Grassland Tavern]] to mourn and to plan what was next.
- They stayed the night for half price after explaining their circumstances. 

### The Camp

- The next day they went back south, with much more of a vengeance against this cult. They arrived and saw the sheer number of kobolds and cultists. They were outnumbered 50 to 1. They decided to climb up the mountain and use it as a safe way to navigate around the camp without being spotted. Daisy and Oswald worked together to create a fire arrow and burn down one of the guard towers to create a distraction. 
- They continued around the top level of the cliffs and saw [[Leosin Erlanthar]] tied up alongside a half orc called [[Thorn (JJ)]]. Helga and Daisy held a long piece of rope down the cliff and Oswald climbed down. He fell the last 10 feet, and caused a bit of noise which alerted a cultist guard standing near the prisoners. The cultist assumed it was the prisoners making the noise and beat Leosin. Thorn intimidated the cultist, and headbutted him. The cultist, after failing the intimidation left. 
- Oswald attempted to use the thieves tools he stole from the general goods store to unlock their chains to no success. Leosin calls him over, and reveals he has a secret knife hidden on his belt. Oswald takes the knife and uses it to untie the prisoners
- Leosin mentions that their weapons have been stashed in a tent opposite. Leosin climbs the rope to safety whilst Oswald and Thorn try and sneak towards the tent. They only just manage to get to the tent unoticed, but there are occupants. Thorn rushes straight to one of the cultists and attempts to hold his mouth to stop him from yelling. This fails but Thorn decides to use "Charm Person" to convince the cultists that they're actually security consultants, making sure that the camp is well defended against attack. The cultists return their weapons without question after failing the save against the spell. 
- After the characters returned to safety at the top of the cliff, Leosin reveals that he's been trying to do research on what are called the "[[Cult of the Dragon]]" and that after hearing about the dragon attack on Greenest, is certain that they've been hatching dragons in a nearby cave. He reveals the cults plan to try and return the dragon god [[Tiamat (Boss)]] to the mortal realm.
