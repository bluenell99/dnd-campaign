> A young man walks up to you, limping heavily on his bandaged left leg. “ I hear that you intend to follow the raiders and see where they’ve gone. I’d like nothing better than to come with you, but in this condition, I’d slow you down. In the midst of all this tragedy, there's no reason you would have heard about the fate of my master, [[Leosin Erlanthar]], but it’s important you know. He is a monk from Berdusk. He disappeared last night, after we fought a particularly savage battle against raiders. A few others and I fought our way to the keep, barely. Leosin didn’t make it
   at all. We went back this morning to look for him, but all we found was his broken staff and this choker, which he always wore."

The monk’s name is [[Nesim Waladra]]. After introductions are made, he continues.

> “ Leosin has been investigating these raiders for months. I fear that he might have tried to infiltrate their group when they retreated, or worse, was captured and carried away
   as a prisoner. No one understands these bandits better than he does, and his knowledge will be invaluable against them. When you find their camp, please look for any sign that Leosin is there. One of my brothers has already departed for Berdusk to bring back help, but it will be many days before help arrives. Anything you can do before then would be a godsend.”

## Tracking the Raiders

The raiders’ path is easy to follow across the rolling grassland of the Greenfields. A wide swath of grass is trampled down, but it’s impossible to determine the raiders’ numbers precisely.  

On a successful Wisdom (Perception) check, the players can determine that the tracks leading out from the town are deeper than the tracks leading in. This is because they were carrying lots of loot and pillaged items from the town. They can also see wheel tracks from a cart.

The trail leads south for around 12 miles. (5 hours).

There are two encounters on the way to the camp.

### Stragglers

Characters spot this group’s cooking fire smoke from several miles away, because the stragglers stopped to roast a few prairie hens for a meal. They sought shelter in a low spot between surrounding hills, where tall boulders have rolled into a loose jumble. In fact, the surroundings offer no protection while making it easier for
enemies to sneak up on the site.

Upon observing the stragglers camp, there are 4 [[Cultist]] and 4 [[Kobold]] 
Cultists could be questioned but will say nothing unless a DC15 Charisma (Wisdom) check. If successful, the cultist can confirm that there is likely a rearguard protecting the back of the raiding party as it's a standard practice, roughly 1 mile ahead. They also know that some prisoners were taken but don't know who or how many. They mainly raided for loot (gold, gems, other valuables) in preperation for "the great hoard to honor the 'Dragon Queen'"

### Rearguard

- If stragglers described the likely ambush spot to characters, it can be recognized from 200 yards away with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

- If stragglers mentioned the rearguard but didn’t describe the spot, it is recognized as a good spot for an ambush from 100 yards away with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)

- If characters haven’t been warned about the rearguard, someone spots a face peering from above with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)

It's smart for the characters to avoid attacking the group as it would alert the main group as they've not arrived on time, and because it's a difficult fight. 

If they do fight, there is 1 [[Guard]], 6 [[Cultist]] and 2 [[Acolyte]]. 

If they walk into the ambush site without spotting it, cultists must make a DC11 Dexterity save or take 2d12 bludgeoning damage from falling rocks. 

If any cultists are captured, the characters must make a successful DC20 Charisma (Intimidation) check to get any information out. They will only say that they are part of the "Cult of the Dragon" and that their leaders are [[Langdedrosa Cyanwrath (Mini Boss)]], [[Rezmir (Mini Boss)]] and [[Frulum Mondath (Mini Boss)]]

## The Camp

### General Features

- **Boulders** are difficult terrain and provide three-quarters cover
- **Brush** grows to 4-6ft. It is difficult terrain and provides three-quarters cover
- **Caves** in the sides of the plateau walls. Boulders & Brush cover the entrances. They are generally safe for a long rest.
- **Guard Towers** have been built at the entrance and at the top of the plateau. 
### Prisoners

Prisoners are kept at location 1 on the map, on the ground level of the camp. There are 8 prisoners, not counting Leosin. During the day they are put to work, during the night they are tied up and shackled to a post inside a hut. Their chains can be unlocked with a key carried by a [[Dragonclaw]] or by lockpicking with DC10 Dexterity (Thieve's Tools) check, or broken completley with a DC20 strength check. 

### Tents

On level 1 there are a number of rudimentary huts thrown together with hide and sticks, decorated with animal skulls. These are for the [[Kobold]]. 

On level 2 there are sturdier and cleaner huts for cultists and acolytes. These are decorated wit painted designs representing dragons. 

Location 2 is a large tent, reserved for the three main leaders [[Langdedrosa Cyanwrath (Mini Boss)]], [[Rezmir (Mini Boss)]] and [[Frulum Mondath (Mini Boss)]]. There is a permanent guard of 4 [[Guard]] and 4 [[Guard Drake]]. 

### Numbers

If the characters want to know how many enemies are in the camp. There are at least 100 kobolds scattered around the camp, squabbling and socialising, Plus many more cultits, acololytes, and general mercenary guards. The party gets the sense that stealth is most likely the best play. 
### Alertness 

(Arrival on Day 1)
The party can attempt to pretend they are part of the raiding group. If questioned, they only need to make a DC5 Charisma check.  If they are wearing any [[Cult of the Dragon]] clothing, they *don't* blend in as no one is wearing it after the raid to avoid suspicion.  [[Helga Thunderaxe - Dwarf Barbarian (Beth)]] will have a -4 penalty to the DC roll. If she ever comes face to face with Langdredosa, she is immediatley recognized. 

(Arrival on Night 1)
The party can try and pretend, however it becomes a DC10 Charisma (Deception) check to get past the guard. 

(Arrival after Night 1)
The party will need to resort to stealth and subterfuge to get in. The whole camp goes on alert if bodies of guards or cultists are found. Dead kobolds can be explained by their nature, unless there's a large number of them.

If the camp goes alert, a DC15 Deception (Charisma) check is required to avoid the alarm being raised. A failure triggers the questioning party to sound the alarm and the camp will start to investigate. A roll of DC10 or lower mean's they've been recognized from Greenest. 

#### Captured!

If caught, characters are disarmed, their hands are tied, and they are brought before [[Frulum Mondath (Mini Boss)]] for judgment. One by one, she asks them who they are, where they came from, and what they’re doing in her camp. 

- If anyone was recognized from the fighting in Greenest, it doesn’t matter what the characters say. Mondath sentences all of them to be executed on the morrow, after spending the night tied to posts alongside the monk Leosin. Characters have one night to escape this fate. 
	- They might wriggle out of their bonds, bribe or charm a cultist to set them free, or come up with a clever use for a cantrip.
	- If all else fails, Leosin reveals that he has a hidden knife with which they can cut themselves free.

- If characters admit they came from Greenest and are enemies of the cult, the effect is the same as if they’d been recognized. 

- If characters lie to Mondath—claiming they are new recruits and this is all a mistake, for  example, or that they are studying the cult before deciding whether to join—then compare their Charisma (Deception) checks to Mondath’s Wisdom check to determine whether she believes them. You can allow advantage or disadvantage on the roll when someone’s lies are especially plausible or implausible. Match die rolls individually for every character. Those who Mondath believes are set free, but watched and stopped if they try to leave the camp. Those who Mondath does not believe are sentenced to die as above.

### Secrets

**Note to Frulum**
The party might be able to uncover a note from [[Rezmir (Mini Boss)]] to [[Frulum Mondath (Mini Boss)]]
(See [[Note from Rezmir to Frulum]])


**Map of Dragon Sightings**

Discover a map with markings indicating recent dragon sightings or activity. This could demonstrate the cult's awareness of dragons in the area, without directly revealing their larger plan involving the dragon masks.
