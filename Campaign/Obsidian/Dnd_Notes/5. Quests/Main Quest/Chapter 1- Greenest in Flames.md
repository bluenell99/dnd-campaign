As characters approach Greenest, they see that a blue dragon and its [[Cult of the Dragon]] allies are attacking the town. The cultists seek to collect treasure that they
hope to present to Tiamat upon her arrival in the world. The cult has assembled a powerful force for this raid by gathering bandits, kobolds, sellswords, and other mer
cenary types into a small army. A monk named Leosin Erlanthar was also in town. Through diligent research and interviews conducted during his travels between
Berdusk and Candlekeep, Leosin became convinced that the cult is engaged in a big operation, but he doesn’t yet know what it is. Leosin uses the raid as an opportu
nity to infiltrate the cult so that he can learn more about the cult’s plans. He is discovered and captured, however, and needs the characters’ help to escape from captivity. 

Characters can engage in several encounters while [[Cultist]] and [[Kobold]] rampage through Greenest. 


## Save the Chapel

If the players are successful, read this: 

> [[Governor Nighthill]] tired gaze acknowledges the players as they return with rescued townsfolk.
>  
   *"You've brought a glimmer of hope to Greenest, and for that, I thank you. However, the shadows of danger still loom. The mill is yet to be secured, and its fate hangs in the balance. I implore you to press on; the threat persists, and our town's survival depends on your continued valor. Greenest's destiny rests in your hands, adventurers."*

## Seek the keep

Characters have random encounters with raiders when they enter Greenest, but this one should be their first mission of the episode. It begins when a terrified human
family (father, mother, and three young children) dash across their path, hounded by eight kobolds. 

> "Without warning, five humans dash out from between two buildings on your left. A limping man and three young children race across the street into more shadows, and a woman carrying a round shield and a broken spear turns and faces back in the direction from which they came. Eight kobolds stream out of the alley on the family’s heels and fan out around the woman, who looks determined to delay the creatures for as long as possible."

Unless characters interfere, the kobolds assume the characters are cultists and ignore them to concentrate on killing the woman first, her family second. Assuming
characters intervene and save the family, Linan explains that they must make their way to the keep it’sthe only safe place in Greenest. 

To reach the keep, the characters must make it past three groups of raiders. A group consists of 1d6 [[Kobold]] and 1d4 [[[Cultist]]]]. If the group contains six kobolds, one
is a [[Winged Kobold]]

## Save the Mill

> *“The guards have spotted a new threat. Raiders are trying to set fire to the town’s mill. If it burns, we’ll lose our stockpile of flour and we won’t be able to grind more for months. I’m trying to assemble enough defenders from here in the keep to defend it through the rest of the night, but that will take time. You’d do us a great service if you could get to the mill quickly and drive away the raiders before they can set it aflame. You’ll need to defend it until our force arrives to take over, but it shouldn’t be more than fifteen minutes behind you.”.*


If the players are successful, read this:

>As your party returns to Greenest, you find [[Governor Nighthill]], the noble with sixty winters etched on his face, waiting to receive you. His tired yet grateful eyes meet yours as you emerge victorious from the mill-saving mission. With a faint smile, he commends your group, *"Your bravery has brought a much-needed respite to Greenest. The mill, a vital lifeline for our town, now stands secure, thanks to your unwavering efforts."


## Dragon Attack

> The adult blue dragon Lennithon accompanied this  raid but is not an enthusiastic participant. Its chief contribution has been its Frightful Presence, but that becomes less effective as the night wears on and defenders overcome their fear. Shortly before midnight, the
   dragon launches a final assault against the citadel. Frulam Mondath orders the attack, knowing that the adventurers are in the keep at the time. Lennithon doesn’t consider this to be its fight, and it isn’t keen on tangling with adventurers for another’s benefit. During this attack, Lennithon flies over the keep and uses his breath weapon without moving closer than 25 feet from the parapet. The defenders on the walls have mastered their fear of the dragon’s Frightful Presence
   from earlier attacks. There are twenty NPC defenders on the walls at the beginning of the mission, and more can arrive between attacks to take the place of those who fall. The dragon doesn’t target the adventures at first, and every breath attack not directed at them kills 1d4
   NPC defenders and injures 1d6 more. Adventurers who happen to get caught in the area make normal saving throws and take standard damage. The NPCs’ attacks are ineffective against Lennithon. Bear in mind that the dragon’s breath weapon will kill a 1st-level character outright, so be sure to demonstrate its destructive power to the players before turning the dragon against the party. After each attack, Lennithon swoops away until his breath weapon recharges, then swings in for another attack. He repeats this pattern until it has taken 24 damage or more, or a single critical hit. After that happens, Lennithon leaves for good. 


## Champion Challenge

Before all the raiders depart, their champion challenges the town’s best warrior. 

> The creature stops about eighty yards from the main gate
   of the keep and scans the walls. A line of kobolds fans out behind it. With their spears,  they prod four human prisoners into the dim light. You can make out a woman,  a teenage boy in a blood-soaked tunic, and two children. Then the half-dragon creature hails the keep. 
   
   "*Defenders of Greenest! This has been a successful
   night, and I am feeling generous. Do you see these four pitiful, useless prisoners? We  have no need for them, so I will trade them back to you. Send out your best warrior to  fight me, and you can have these four in exchange.”*

Cyanwrath is pleased to see a champion step forward. He agrees to these terms for the combat: The three children will be set loose immediately, but his kobolds will
continue to stand guard over the woman, and they will kill her if anyone interferes in the fight—for example, if archers in the keep let fly at him. Regardless of who
wins, the woman will be released when the fight is over; and the victor will be the last one standing.
