## Greenest to Elturel (Horseback)

### Encounters
#### Children Playing

Near a small hamlet three kids are playing next to the road. Two are standing under a large oak while the third is climbing it to reach a nest of eggs. It seems dangerous as the nest is quite high up, but the kid is determined. Interference is an option and several scenarios might occur; He climbs too far up in the thin branches and will fall, he climbs up but doesnâ€™t dare to come back down, the couple of crows of whom the nest is come back and will attack him defending the nest. If something bad is prevented their parents will offer free dinner, a place to sleep warm, and a blueberry pie for on the road. 

The players will have a place to keep the horses safe. 

#### Rockfang Raiders Attack Aftermath

Further up the road, the party comes across another small hamlet. The hamlet acts as a small trading post for local farms as the road runs through the centre of the hamlet. Upon arrival, they notice the place has been attacked, and left with all but one survivor. A small boy called [[Terrance]] who's hiding in a brush by one of the farms. 


### Elturel

> "As the sun sets over the sprawling city of Elturel, nestled gracefully along the banks of the River Chionthar, a mesmerizing sight comes into view. The city, bustling with activity, exudes an air of orderliness and commerce. Merchants bustle through the streets, river traders navigate the waters, and farmers proudly display their goods in lively markets. Yet amidst this bustling scene, what truly captivates the eye is the ethereal glow that bathes the city in a radiant light. A brilliant magical illumination, suspended above Elturel, casts its glow both day and night, lending an otherworldly ambiance to this vibrant urban landscape"

The party will need to find [[Onthar Frume]] who can be found at [[A Pair of Black Antlers]]]. He will brief the party on their actual task. 

They will also find [[Leosin Erlanthar ]].

Both characters want the party to join their respective factions. Onthar works with [[The Order of the Gauntlet]], whereas Leosin works for [[The Harpers]].

## Elturel to Baldur's Gate

This journey is pretty uneventful, and only takes a few days using the provided boat.

### Encounters

#### Water Spirit

Just of the road there is a short trail to a small pond. It is the spring of a rather large river downstream, a water spirit (marid/nereid) lives here. She is very picky about who and what may take water from her spring. You must be clean, you must be nice, and you must not stare at her delicate parts. Those that bring her suitable favours she will fill their water skin personally and turn it into a potion of (minor) healing, and the "Gift of the Water Spirit" which grants a user to half the amount of damage they take once.  If any hostilities break out she will curse the perpetrators with thirst, water will turn to dust upon touching their lips, and flee through the spring.

##### Favours

**Gift of a Precious Stone:** The water spirit desires a beautiful gemstone or a rare crystal to adorn her underwater dwelling. This could be anything from a shimmering aquamarine to a sparkling diamond.

**Musical Performance:** The water spirit has a fondness for music and request a performance from one of the party members, particularly if they have proficiency in musical instruments. This could involve playing a soothing melody or performing a graceful dance by the pond.

**Act of Kindness to Wildlife:** The water spirit may be a protector of the local wildlife and request that the party perform an act of kindness towards the creatures in the river. A collection of fish have gotten caught and trapped within rubble and debris in the river. 


### Baldur's Gate

> Nestled along the rugged coastline of the Sea of Swords, the bustling city of Baldur's Gate stands as a beacon of commerce and opportunity. From dawn till dusk, the city pulses with the energy of trade, as caravans laden with goods from the north and south traverse the ancient Trade Way, while ships sail in from distant shores to dock in its bustling harbor. From the east, the River Chionthar serves as a lifeline, bringing goods from Cormyr and Sembia to further enrich the city's bustling markets. Perched upon a prominent bluff overlooking the river, Baldur's Gate commands a strategic position, its natural harbor offering safe haven to seafarers and merchants alike. It's a city where the currents of trade converge, where fortunes are made and lost amidst the ceaseless hustle and bustle of commerce.


### Merchants

There are 20 merchants in the caravan. The players will find them in the [[Marketplace]] in Baldur's Gate.
