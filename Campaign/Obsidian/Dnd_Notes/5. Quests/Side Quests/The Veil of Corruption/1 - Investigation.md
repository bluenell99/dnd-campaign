## Hostile Shadow Creatures

- **Appearance:** The creatures in the forest are twisted and corrupted by shadow magic. Their once-vibrant fur, feathers, or scales now exude an unnatural darkness. Eyes gleam with malevolence, and their movements are erratic and aggressive.
- **Behavior:** Previously docile creatures, such as deer, rabbits, and songbirds, are now aggressive and attack intruders on sight. The corrupted creatures move in shadowy packs, coordinating their attacks with an unnatural intelligence.
## Signs of Malevolent Force

- **Dark Energy Residue:** The party notices faint traces of dark energy lingering in the air, leaving an otherworldly residue on nearby plants and rocks. These residues resemble smoky, shadowy tendrils.
- **Distorted Plant Life:** Flora in the affected areas bears signs of corruption. Leaves droop, flowers wilt, and the once-lush vegetation takes on a sickly appearance. Some plants exude an ominous glow.
## Eerie Atmosphere

- **Unsettling Sounds:** Strange whispers and distorted animal cries echo through the forest. The party hears these eerie sounds, creating a sense of unease and contributing to the overall haunting atmosphere.
- **Shifting Shadows:** The shadows cast by trees and rocks seem to move independently, creating an unsettling illusion. It's as if the very shadows are alive and reacting to the party's presence.
## Mysterious Symbols

- **Enigmatic Markings:** The party discovers enigmatic symbols carved into the trunks of ancient trees or etched onto rocks. These symbols resonate with dark magic and seem to be a form of communication or ritualistic marking.
- **Symbiotic Wildlife:** Certain corrupted creatures have markings resembling the symbols. It becomes evident that these creatures are directly connected to the dark magic affecting the forest.

## Survivor

The party comes across a frightened hunter or druid who managed to escape an encounter with the corrupted creatures. The survivor shares their harrowing experience, providing valuable information about the creatures' behaviors and the direction of the tainted areas.

The survivor is [[Elara]], who can give them some hints if the party get stuck but she is unable to fight due to her injuries
