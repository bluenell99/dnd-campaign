The corrupted nexus is a clearing within the heart of the forest, where dark energy converges. The air here feels heavy with malevolence, and the ground pulses with an otherworldly rhythm. The center of the clearing holds a mysterious, obsidian-like monolith adorned with pulsating runes.
## Runes

The runes and markings on the nexus are similar to what have been seen scorched into the nearby trees. 

1) Death
2) Shade
3) Force
4) Nexus
5) Exude

[[Elara]] has already figured out that the marking for letter 'E', 'D' and 'S' and 'A' and knows that the letters also aren't 'B', 'I', and 'P'

DEA--
S-ADE
----E
-E--S
E--D-

They need to be re-arranged to create to say "Nexus Exude Force Death Shade"
