The once-bloody battleground remains haunted by the remnants of warfare. Bones, weathered by time, still dot the fields, a grim testament to the violence that once raged across the land. Cairns, solemn monuments to the fallen, stand as silent sentinels amidst the fields now reclaimed for farming and ranching. Yet, even as plows break the earth in the pursuit of sustenance, they occasionally unearth grim reminders of the past - skeletons clad in rusting armor, weapons dulled by age, and other detritus of war. It's a poignant reminder that beneath the tranquil facade of everyday life, the echoes of conflict still resonate, weaving a somber tapestry of remembrance and reflection.
