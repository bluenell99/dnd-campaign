Cotton Hamlet consists of a cluster of modest wooden houses, barns, and outbuildings arranged around a central square.  The aftermath of the attack left no survivors. Bodies lay scattered around the fields. Crops are pillaged and destroyed. The buildings are left in a state of disrepair. 

Painted on the building walls is a familiar symbol. A face, half of an orc, and half of a bugbear. This is clearly the work of the [[Rockfang Raiders]]

If the group investigate the town further, they will hear the sound of sniffling and rustling. A single child has survived the attack, hidden away in a pile of discarded wheat.
