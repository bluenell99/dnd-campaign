Elturel, a large, orderly city overlooking the River Chionthar, is filled with merchants, river traders, and farmersâ€™
markets. Its most distinguishing feature is a brilliant magical light that hovers above it, illuminating it day and
night. This light is painful to undead and is visible from almost every corner of Elturgard (of which Elturel is the
capital), appearing from afar as a star or distant sun.
