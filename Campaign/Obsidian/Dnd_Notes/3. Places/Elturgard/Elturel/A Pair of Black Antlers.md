_Large Tavern (Headquarters of [[The Order of the Gauntlet]]

---

Nestled within the heart of the bustling city, A Pair of Black Antlers stands as a beacon of camaraderie and valor, its sturdy wooden facade adorned with a pair of intricately carved black antlers serving as a symbol of strength and unity. As patrons step through the heavy oak doors, they are enveloped by the lively ambiance of the tavern, the air thick with the scent of hearty stew and the sound of laughter and camaraderie echoing off the walls.

The main hall of the tavern is adorned with banners emblazoned with the sigil of the Order of the Gauntlet, a reminder to all who enter of the noble cause championed within its walls. At the center of the room stands a grand stone hearth, its flames casting a warm glow across the faces of patrons gathered around wooden tables, swapping tales of adventure and sharing in the bond of fellowship. Behind the bar, a burly bartender with a welcoming smile serves drinks poured from barrels labeled with the insignia of the Order, while a serving wench weaves through the crowd, delivering platters of hearty fare to hungry patrons.

Within the tavern, members of the Order of the Gauntlet can often be found strategizing and planning their next mission, their presence marked by the gleam of armor and the clink of swords at their belts. As the sun sets and the city outside fades into darkness, the fires of determination burn ever brighter within the walls of A Pair of Black Antlers, a bastion of hope and courage in a world besieged by darkness.
