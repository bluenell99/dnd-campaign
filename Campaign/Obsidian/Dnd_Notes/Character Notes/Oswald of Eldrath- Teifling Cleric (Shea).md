### Backstory 
In the shadowed realm of Eldrath, where celestial and infernal energies intermingle, your tiefling cleric, Oswald of eldrath, was born under an ominous lunar eclipse. Raised in a small, secluded village, he faced prejudice and mistrust due to his infernal heritage. Oswald's innate connection to the divine manifested early in life when he healed a wounded animal with a touch. Recognizing his potential, a wandering cleric named Seraphina took him under her wing. Seraphina, a devotee of a deity of balance, sensed the duality within Oslwald and believed he could be a bridge between light and darkness. As Oswald trained in the sacred arts, a malevolent force known as the Voidweaver emerged, threatening to unravel the fabric of reality. Seraphina revealed that Oswalds's unique tiefling blood held the key to sealing the interdimensional rift caused by the Voidweaver's influence. Now, armed with a mace blessed by his deity, Oswald roams the realms, seeking knowledge and allies to confront the growing darkness. His journey is a constant struggle to reconcile her infernal lineage with his divine calling, as he strives to prove that even a tiefling can be a beacon of hope in a world threatened by encroaching shadows
