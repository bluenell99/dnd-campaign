## Description

Zolgar is a wiry man with a perpetual squint, as if he's always sizing you up for a potential deal. His clothing is a mishmash of patched robes and faded cloaks, giving him the appearance of a wandering vagabond rather than a reputable merchant. Despite his unassuming demeanor, there's a cunning glint in his eye that hints at a shrewd business mind.

Zolgar sets up shop in dimly lit alleyways or tucked away corners of bustling markets, always on the lookout for potential customers seeking potions of dubious origin. His voice is low and gravelly, with a hint of a wheedling tone when he's trying to make a sale. He's quick to offer discounts to those who appear desperate or naive, but his prices are always steep for those who can afford them. There's a sense of danger lingering around Zolgar, as if dealing with him comes with unseen risks beyond the questionable quality of his wares.
