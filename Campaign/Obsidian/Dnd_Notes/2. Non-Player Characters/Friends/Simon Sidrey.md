### Backstory
Simon Sidrey hails from the tranquil village of Eldor's Rest, a place where tales of heroism and valor were woven into the fabric of everyday life. Raised by his father, a skilled blacksmith, Simon grew up with a heart full of dreams inspired by the chivalric stories shared around the hearth.

At the age of fourteen, Eldor's Rest fell prey to a malevolent necromancer, shrouding the village in darkness. Simon's family succumbed to the horrors unleashed upon them, leaving him orphaned and fueled by a fervent desire for justice. In the aftermath, Simon pledged to rid the world of undead and evil, carrying the weight of his village's tragedy.

Supported by the villagers, Simon sought the guidance of Sir Reynald, a local knight known for his bravery. The knight, recognizing the earnestness and naivety in Simon's eyes, took him in as a squire. Simon, armed with an oversized sword and wide-eyed enthusiasm, eagerly absorbed the teachings of chivalry, blissfully unaware of the complexities of the world beyond Eldor's Rest.

As he embarked on his quest, Simon faced the challenges of a reality far removed from the idyllic tales of his childhood. His idealism clashed with the ambiguous motives of those he encountered, and the moral gray areas tested the purity of his convictions. Throughout haunted forests and ancient crypts, Simon remained resolute in his pursuit of justice, determined to bring honor to Eldor's Rest.

With each step, Simon Sidrey, the naive yet valiant squire, leaves an indelible mark on the world. His companions, more experienced and weary, find themselves not only battling undead horrors but also shielding Simon from the harsh truths that lurk in the shadows of his heroic aspirations.
