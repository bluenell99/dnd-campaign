*Wood Elf, 127 years, Female

---

Elara is a seasoned Wood Elf hunter with sun-kissed skin and sharp, perceptive eyes that betray a hint of weariness. Her long, auburn hair is tied into practical braids, adorned with feathers and small trinkets. Despite her years of experience, the recent encounters in the tainted forest have left her visibly shaken, and there's a haunted look in her eyes as she recounts the horrors she faced. She wears a mix of weathered leather and intricately woven forest garb, adorned with trophies from her previous successful hunts.
