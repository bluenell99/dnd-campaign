## Description

Terrance is a small, wide-eyed child with tousled brown hair and a smattering of freckles across his cheeks. Despite the tragedy that has befallen him, there's a sense of innocence and curiosity that shines through his tear-streaked face. He clutches a ragged stuffed bear tightly to his chest, his only source of comfort in a world turned upside down.

Having lost his family and friends in the brutal raid by the orc tribe, Terrance is now alone in the world, struggling to comprehend the enormity of his loss. He wanders the ruins of his former home, his footsteps hesitant and uncertain as he searches for any sign of life amidst the devastation. Too young to fully grasp the concept of death, he still holds onto hope that his loved ones will return, unaware of the harsh reality that they are gone forever.

Terrance's innocence makes him vulnerable in a world filled with danger and uncertainty, but it also serves as a beacon of light in the darkness, a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit in the face of tragedy. As he navigates the aftermath of the orc raid, he will need guidance and protection from those who are willing to lend him a helping hand and offer him the care and compassion he so desperately needs.

He's terrified of Thorn, as he resembles the orc that attacked the village.
