## Description

Rockfang Spine-Ripper is a towering figure, standing over seven feet tall with bulging muscles and a menacing presence that commands fear and respect in equal measure. His skin is a mottled mix of green and gray, bearing scars from countless battles, and his tusks jut out from his lower jaw in a savage display of primal ferocity. Despite his brutish appearance, there's a cunning intelligence gleaming in his yellow eyes, hinting at a mind sharpened by years of survival in the harsh wilderness.

As the leader of the fearsome orc and bugbear tribe, Rockfang rules with an iron fist, demanding unwavering loyalty from his followers and crushing any dissent with ruthless efficiency. His deep, rumbling voice carries across the camp, instilling both awe and fear in those who hear it. Yet beneath his savage exterior lies a keen understanding of strategy and tactics, honed through years of leading his warriors in raids and skirmishes against rival tribes and unsuspecting settlements. Rockfang Spine-Ripper is a force to be reckoned with, a living embodiment of the wild and untamed spirit of the wilderness.
