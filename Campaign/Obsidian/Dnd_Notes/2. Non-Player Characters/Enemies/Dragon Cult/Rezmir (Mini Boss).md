If she is wearing the Black Dragon Mask, Rezmir can take up to two legendary actions between each of her turns, taking the actions all at once or spreading them over the round. A legendary action can be taken only at the start or end of a turn. Rezmir has the following legendary action options, some of which expend more than one action when taken: 

A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends from a point Rezmir can see within 60 feet of her and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as Rezmir maintains concentration, up to 1 minute. A creature with darkvision canâ€™t see through this darkness, and no natural
light can illuminate it. If any of the area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled. (Costs 2 actions)

Rezmir makes one melee attack (Costs 1 action)

Rezmir takes the Hide action (Costs 1 action)
