There exists a dragon mask for each chromatic dragon colour. Individually it allows the wearer to communicate with dragons. A wearer with a great amount of knowledge in draconic lore will become a Wyrmspeaker while wearing the mask, allowing them to think like a dragon, gain favour among them, and subtly influence their behaviour. 

When all 5 masks are brought together, it creates the "Mask of the Dragon Queen". This will release [[Tiamat (Boss)]] from her prison in the nine-hells. 

The cult's mission is devoted to finding the remaining dragon masks.
