The Cult of the Dragon venerated dragons, evil dragons in particular, and specifically dead evil dragons. They reanimated the gargantuan corpses as powerful and fell dracoliches. The Cult acted as an information network for its draconian "masters", brought gems and riches as offerings, and encouraged evil dragons to become dracoliches. Their belief was that dracoliches were destined to one day rule [[3. Places/Faerun]] and beyond. They could become inhabited by objects which were created in their image especially with the image of the skull.

The cult's leaders are called the [[Wearers of Purple]]
